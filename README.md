# About

This repo contains Julia Rodd's assignments from the MSDS 420 Machine Learning class. This class was taught exclusively in Python.

# Repo structure

The data folder contains data for most assignments. The data for assignments 5-8 are not directly shared due to their large size.

The output folder contains Jupyter notebooks. Both the code and write-up are provided within these files.

# Assignments

Located within the output folder, the assignments can be summarized as follows:

* Assignment 2: uses data from past bank marketing campaigns to predict responses. Logistic regression, Naive Bayes, and Random Forests are three methods considered.
* Assignments 3-4: uses Boston housing market data to predict home values. Regression-based methods (linear,  lasso, ridge) and tree-based methods (random forests and gbms) are used.
* Assignment 5: uses MNIST data to demonstrate PCA and its effectiveness using a Random Forest classifier. Results are submitted to Kaggle.
* Assignments 6-8: these assignments comprise the deep learning portion of the class. Assignment 6 is an introduction to deep learning using sklearn MLPClassifier, while assignments 7 (CNN) and 8 (RNN) utilize tensorflow.
